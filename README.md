Image Segmentation and Visualization
This repository contains a Python script for performing image segmentation using the Felzenszwalb algorithm 
and visualizing the results. Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision and allows us to divide 
an image into distinct regions or segments based on certain criteria.

Requirements
Python 3.x
matplotlib
skimage

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have the required libraries installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Adjust the path of the input image in the code by setting the image_path variable to the location of your desired image.
Fine-tune the segmentation parameters by adjusting scale, sigma, and size_threshold according to your needs.
Execute the script to perform image segmentation and visualize the results.

Description
The script uses the Felzenszwalb algorithm for segmentation, implemented in the skimage.segmentation.felzenszwalb function. 
It then merges smaller segments using a specified size threshold. The resulting segmented image is overlaid with boundaries 
and color-coded for better visualization.

Output
The script will display the following images:

The original input image.
The segmented image with jet colormap visualization.
The segmented image with color overlay.
The boundary overlay for visualizing the segmented regions.
Examples
You can refer to the provided example image (inp_im.jpg) to see the segmentation and visualization results.

Acknowledgments
This code is built upon the functionalities of the skimage library. The skimage.io.imread, skimage.segmentation.felzenszwalb, and other functions are used for image loading, segmentation, and visualization.

Feel free to use this code for your image segmentation and visualization tasks. If you find it helpful, kindly consider giving credit to this repository.

Note: This code is not optimized for real-time processing or large-scale datasets, and it is meant for educational and experimental purposes.
